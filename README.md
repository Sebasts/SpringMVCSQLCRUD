## This is a simple CRUD MEMO app build by me. Go to website http://34.205.145.21:8080/SpringMVCFileCRUD/. Create an account Create reminders or memos. You can create, edit, and delete reminders and memos. I used Spring MVC, Gradle, and Hibernate libraries for input validation.

In the future, I want to be able to have the user enter a time an date so that the memo can be emailed... or even texted to them at the requested time.


There were a lot of stumbling points. Centering a div.. making an entire div clickable. Saving the data to a csv file and reading it back... still some issues there.
