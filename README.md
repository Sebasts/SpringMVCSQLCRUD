## This is a simple CRUD MEMO app build by me. Go to website http://34.205.145.21:8080/remember/. Create an account. Create reminders or memos. You can create, edit, and delete reminders and memos. When creating a memo, you can input a date and time for it to be emailed to you. I used a MySql/Java backend with Spring, Gradle, and Hibernate libraries for input validation.

It doesn't look pretty yet but it does what it claims to do.
